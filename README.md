Yes, frontend submission is a core feature. Configure who can submit (anyone, logged-in users, specific roles) in **Settings > Submission**. You can also enable guest submission with email capture.

### How do I require approval for new listings?

Go to **Listings > Settings > Listings** and set "Default Listing Status" to "Pending Review". New submissions will require admin approval before becoming visible.

### Can I add custom fields to listings?

Yes! The plugin includes 25+ field types. To add custom fields, use the `apd_listing_fields` filter in your theme's `functions.php`:

```php
add_filter( 'apd_listing_fields', function( $fields ) {
    $fields['business_hours'] = [
        'type'     => 'textarea',
        'label'    => 'Business Hours',
        'required' => false,
    ];
    return $fields;
});
```

### Is the plugin translation ready?

### How do I enable reviews?

Reviews are enabled by default. To disable them, go to **Listings > Settings > Listings** and uncheck "Enable Reviews". You can moderate reviews under **Listings > Reviews**.

### How do I customize email notifications?

Email templates can be overridden in your theme at `your-theme/all-purpose-directory/emails/`. You can also customize the from name, email, and which notifications are sent in **Settings > Email**.

### Can I import existing listings?

The plugin uses standard WordPress post types, so you can use any WordPress import tool. WP All Import works great for CSV/XML imports. The post type is `apd_listing` and meta keys use the `_apd_` prefix.

### Is there a REST API?

Yes, the plugin provides a full REST API at `/wp-json/apd/v1/` with endpoints for listings, categories, tags, favorites, reviews, and inquiries. Authentication uses WordPress nonces for logged-in users.

### How do I change the number of columns in grid view?

Go to **Listings > Settings > Display** and set "Grid Columns" to 2, 3, or 4. You can also use the `columns` attribute on the shortcode: `[apd_listings columns="3"]`.

### Does the plugin create custom database tables?
